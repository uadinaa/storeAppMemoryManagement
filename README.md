# Store App â€“ iOS Development Project

## Overview
Developed an iOS store application focusing on memory management, collections performance, and protocol implementation. The app enables users to create profiles, upload profile pictures, and post items to a social feed.

## Key Features & Implementation:

- Advanced Memory Management: Used ARC principles, implemented weak/unowned references to prevent retain cycles, and optimized closures.
- Optimized Data Structures: Selected appropriate collection types (e.g., dictionaries for fast lookups, arrays for ordered posts, sets for unique hashtags).
- Protocol-Oriented Design: Implemented Hashable and Equatable for user profiles and posts, ensuring efficient comparisons and storage.
- Profile Management: Enabled user profile creation with persistent storage and real-time updates.
- Dynamic Feed System: Allowed users to add categorized items, filter posts, and manage listings efficiently.
- Asynchronous Image Loading: Implemented image loading with proper reference management to avoid memory leaks.
- This project was developed as part of an iOS Advanced Development assignment and demonstrates expertise in Swift, UIKit, ARC, and data structure optimization.
